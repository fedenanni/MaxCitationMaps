To run the notebook with a new input:

1. Create a folder in input, for instance "032022"
2. Add the input files inside
3. Change in the code the "month" variable
4. In case some country coordinates are missing, add them similar to the ones just added (for instance "coords["KUWAIT"] = ["29.3759", "47.9774"])
